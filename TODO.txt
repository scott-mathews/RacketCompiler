Todo:

1. Fix printing for functions.

2. Double check proper passing of parameters for functions
   as they propagate downward.

3. Test functions on simple examples (no vectors) to identify
   problems.

4. Determine source of issues with vectors (why doesn't it
	 work?)

5. Repair register allocation to spill less.
5.1 Double check correctness of some hardcoded
    register in select-instructions.
